= Getting started

== Prerequisites

[#knowledge]
=== Knowledge

* Be comfortable with the UNIX command line
** navigating directories
** editing files
** a little bit of bash-fu (environment variables, loops)

* Some Docker knowledge
** `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`
** ideally, you know how to write a Dockerfile and build it (even if it's a `FROM` line and a couple of `RUN` commands)
** It's totally OK if you are not a Docker expert!

[#resources]
=== Resources

* You need an access to a GCP project with activated billing
* Your user should have sufficient access on GCP ressources such as :
** ability to create a GKE cluster
** ability to create a compute instances
** ability to access, create and modify external services such as storage
** ...

[#gcloud_commands]
=== Be able to issues `gcloud` commands

In order to issue all the commands of this workshop you should choose one of this solution:

. Use an existing installation Gcloud SDK and its `gcloud` cli
. Use "Cloud Shell" tool on GCP console

If you already have the `gcloud` cli installed, make sure you use the appropriate project by running :

```bash
gcloud projects list
gcloud config set project ${YOUR_PROJECT}
```

Otherwise if you don't have it install you can use GCP inner tool "Cloud Shell" :

* Connect to GCP console and select your project under the top navbar
* Click on "Activate Cloud Shell"

Execute commands bellow to display your currrent account and project:

```shell
gcloud config list account
gcloud config list project
```

Set current project if it’s not yours project ID:

```shell
gcloud config set project <project ID>
```

Set default region/zone:

```shell
gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b
```

Clone the workshop repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:stack-labs-tech/gcp-k8s-istio.git
```

[#microservices]
== Get to know the microservices

Kubernetes and Istio both aim at quicly and reliably deploying applications, and that's exactly what you will learn to do during this workshop. In order to do that we should first know what we are going to deploy during this entire workshop, it's time to meet the architecture !

We will be using a set of microservices that generate dumb travels from one city to another and is able to display the list of travels done so far.

Our microservices architecture looks like this :

image:microservices-architecture.png[Microservices architecture]

* *travel-manager*: a service that has a background worker responsible for generating random travels, storing them to a Redis, and that also exposes endpoints to request travels
* *distance-calculator*: a service responsible for calculating the distance between the city
* *redis*: a https://redis.io/[Redis] store that will store all the travels manipulated by our microservices.

Even if we won't explore the code of each microservice in this workshop, note that all the microservices have been developed using https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut framework].

Congratulations, you’re ready to start this workshop !!
