= Getting started

== Setting up Gitlab

You will not be surprised to know that this entire workshop will be based on https://gitlab.com[, window="_blank"].

If you already own a ðŸ¦Š account, you could ignore next step and jump directly to <<gitlab-repos>> section.

=== Create your account

To join the wonderful world of Gitlab, please go to https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane[, window="_blank"].

=== Generate and add your SSH key

You need to generate and configure an SSH key for interacting with Gitlab from your machine.

Please follow these two steps :

- https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair[Generate an SSH key, window="_blank"]
- https://gitlab.com/help/ssh/README#adding-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account[Install an SSH key, window="_blank"]

TIP: If you already get an existing key on your machine you could use it

[#gitlab-repos]
=== Organize your repos

We have created a dedicated group for the workshop, it could be reached using https://gitlab.com/gke-training[, window="_blank"]

Go to `DevFest Paris 2019` subgroup and click on `Request Access` button to join it. Now don't hesitate to ping us for your access to be granted.

One your access is accepted, create a *public* project under group to define your workspace. You can use the first letter of your firstname concatenated to your lastname as project name (e.g `kdavin` or `lweber`).

Go to project repository settings (`\https://gitlab.com/gke-training/devfest-paris-2019/*<username>*/settings/repository`) and click on `unprotect` orange button under `protected branches` section

CAUTION: Joining the main group is important because some dedicated runners will be attached to it in case Gitlab.com ones fail.

TIP: When an exercise is finished, you can move your project outside the workshop group to keep it in a personal namespace (`Settings -> General -> Transfer project`)

[#kotlin]
== Setting up Kotlin environment

NOTE: Following instructions are not mandatory and useful only if you want to compile Kotlin code locally

To make the workshop funnier and classier, we decided to use https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin, window="_blank"] as main language in exercises.

*_You're totally newbie why Kotlin ?_*

Don't worry, we'll drive you along exercises and code samples will be furnished to be focused on Gitlab C.I part ðŸ˜‰

*_You hate Kotlin or Kotlin is so easy for you ?_*

Increase difficulty and feel free to use another language for all the workshop !

We encourage you to use the `IntelliJ IDEA` IDE in this community edition but you're free to use your preferred IDE.
The following guide is perfect for getting started with Kotlin : https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html[, window="_blank"]

Congratulations, you're now ready to start this workshop ðŸš€
