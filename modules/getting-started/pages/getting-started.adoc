[#gcloud_commands]
=== Be able to issues `gcloud` commands

In order to issue all the commands of this workshop you should choose one of this solution:

. Use an existing installation Gcloud SDK and its `gcloud` cli
. Use "Cloud Shell" tool on GCP console

If you already have the `gcloud` cli installed, make sure you use the appropriate project by running :

```bash
gcloud projects list
gcloud config set project ${YOUR_PROJECT}
```

Otherwise if you don't have it install you can use GCP inner tool "Cloud Shell" :

* Connect to GCP console and select your project under the top navbar
* Click on "Activate Cloud Shell"
