= Production path with Istio

The goal of this step is to discover the *Istio Way* of going to *production*. Thanks to the different functionality of Istio, we can improve our process of delivery inside a Kubernetes Cluster.

Basically, we have to deploy the *Search* v2 but without any downtime and with assurance no error will occurs.

== Setup

We will work on the demo mode like in the previous step and do some modification upon it

[#mirroring]
== Traffic Mirroring

One of the first solution to test an application is to deploy the new version and mirror the traffic of the standard one to the new version.

First, we will deploy the *v2* version of the *Search* service. To do so, you have to apply the following yaml:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: search-v2
  labels:
    app: search
    version: v2
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 8080
  selector:
    app: search
    version: v2
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: search
    version: v2
  name: search-v2
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: search
      version: v2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: search
        version: v2
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: stacklabs/gke-and-istio-search:v2-with-errors # <1>
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
            - name: SEARCH_VERSION
              value: v2
            - name: SEARCH_EVENT
              value: "GKE + Istio Formation"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health
              port: 8181
            initialDelaySeconds: 20
          name: search
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
              protocol: TCP
----
<1> Special version of this service which randomly returns errors


We can see the new deployment with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ kubectl get services,po
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE

pod/ui-v1-7f54ffb994-tvc89       2/2     Running   0          53m

Here, we don't have any specific elements about istio. Our app should answer like before, without problems.

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ while true; curl -qs 35.228.54.223; echo ; end
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-19T20:18:05.468Z"}

{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-19T20:18:15.855Z"}

And logs from *Search* v2 application are empty

//TODO Add logs from terminal | stackdriver

Now, we will configure Istio to mirror all the traffic to *Search* v1 to *Search* v2, by applying this yaml:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  hosts:
    - search
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-1
      mirror: # <1>
        host: search
        subset: version-2
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  host: search
  subsets:
    - name: version-1
      labels:
        version: v1
    - name: version-2 # <2>
      labels:
        version: v2
----
<1> The mirror syntax to send all routed traffic to a specific subset
<2> The definition of the specific subset by label

We can now see logs inside our terminal with the following command:

//TODO add terminal logs for this case

We need to analyse the system, so we can define a graph in stackdriver monitoring to see this:

image:04-production-path-with-istio/01_stackdriver-error-on-app-by-version.png[Analysing the mirroring traffic app]

To generate the same graph, you have to define:

* Resource Type: *Kubernetes Container*
* Metric: *Log Entries*
* Filter:
** *severity = "ERROR"*
** *namespace_name = "workshop"*
* Group By:
** user_labels.app
** user_labels.version
* Aggregator: *sum*

In order to fix the issue, we will deploy a working version of the v2 application. You need to apply this YAML file.

              value: v2
            - name: SEARCH_EVENT
              value: "GKE + Istio Formation"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health
              port: 8181
            initialDelaySeconds: 20

          ports:

              name: http
              protocol: TCP
----
<1> Special version of this service which randomly returns errors

You can now see errors raising down from the stackdriver graph and the logs of your application printing less errors.
