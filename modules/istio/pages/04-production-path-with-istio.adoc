= Production path with Istio

The goal of this step is to discover the *Istio Way* of going to *production*. Thanks to the different functionality of Istio, we can improve our process of delivery inside a Kubernetes Cluster.

Basically, we have to deploy the *Search* v2 but without any downtime and with assurance no error will occurs.

[#setup]
== Setup

We will work on the demo mode like in the previous step and do some modification upon it

[#mirroring]
== Traffic Mirroring

One of the first solution to test an application is to deploy the new version and mirror the traffic of the standard one to the new version.

First, we will deploy the *v2* version of the *Search* service. To do so, you have to apply the following yaml:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: search-v2
  labels:
    app: search
    version: v2
spec:

      port: 8080
  selector:
    app: search
    version: v2

          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
            - name: SEARCH_VERSION
              value: v2
            - name: SEARCH_EVENT
              value: "GKE + Istio Formation"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health
              port: 8181
            initialDelaySeconds: 20
          name: search
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
              protocol: TCP
----
<1> Special version of this service which randomly returns errors


We can see the new deployment with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
Œõ\:$ kubectl get services,po

Here, we don't have any specific elements about istio. Our app should answer like before, without problems.

[source, bash]
----
Œõ\:$ while true; curl -qs 35.228.54.223; echo ; end

And logs from *Search* v2 application are empty

//TODO Add logs from terminal | stackdriver

Now, we will configure Istio to mirror all the traffic to *Search* v1 to *Search* v2, by applying this yaml:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  hosts:
    - search
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-1
      mirror: # <1>
        host: search
        subset: version-2
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  host: search
  subsets:
    - name: version-1
      labels:
        version: v1
    - name: version-2 # <2>
      labels:
        version: v2
----
<1> The mirror syntax to send all routed traffic to a specific subset
<2> The definition of the specific subset by label

We can now see logs inside our terminal with the following command:

//TODO add terminal logs for this case

We need to analyse the system, so we can define a graph in stackdriver monitoring to see this:

image:04-production-path-with-istio/01_stackdriver-error-on-app-by-version.png[Analysing the mirroring traffic app]

To generate the same graph, you have to define:

* Resource Type: *Kubernetes Container*
* Metric: *Log Entries*
* Filter:
** *severity = "ERROR"*
** *namespace_name = "workshop"*
* Group By:
** user_labels.app
** user_labels.version
* Aggregator: *sum*

In order to fix the issue, we will deploy a working version of the v2 application. You need to apply this YAML file.

[source, yaml]

              name: http
              protocol: TCP

You can now see errors raising down from the stackdriver graph and the logs of your application printing less errors.

[#canary-release]
== Canary release

The main goal of a canary release it to be able to deploy 2 version of a service and let the user decide if he wants to access the "canary" release.

To do this step, you should first be sure you have deployed *UI* v1 and *Search* v1 & v2 in your cluster.

[source, bash]
----
Œõ\:$ kubectl get services,po
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE

service/ui       ClusterIP   10.121.0.228   <none>        8080/TCP   53m

NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/search-v1-6b9967c46c-thcct   2/2     Running   0          3m8s
pod/search-v2-7bf6c4ccc5-fn868   2/2     Running   0          8m37s
pod/ui-v1-7f54ffb994-tvc89       2/2     Running   0          53m
----

Then, the goal here is to use the `HTTPMatchRequest` (https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/virtual-service/#HTTPMatchRequest[documentation]) to control the traffic depending of the value of the *http-header* `x-formation-search`.

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:

      route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-2 <2>
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-1 <3>
---

      labels:
        version: v1
    - name: version-2
      labels:
        version: v2
----
<1> The parameter which allow to redirect traffic to a specific destination
<2> The route -> destination used if the request match
<3> The default route if nothing match

[source, bash]
----
Œõ\:$ curl 35.228.32.51
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-20T16:55:58.391Z"}
Œõ\:$ curl 35.228.32.51 -H "x-formation-search: next"
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v2)","date":"2019-05-20T16:56:45.613Z"}
Œõ\:$ curl 35.228.32.51 -H "x-formation-search: other"
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-20T16:57:33.823Z"}
----

This is possible only because the *UI* application forwards all incoming headers with name `x-formation-search` to others micro services.

TIP: This is possible thanks to Spring Cloud Sleuth in our context, or this can be manually in our app
