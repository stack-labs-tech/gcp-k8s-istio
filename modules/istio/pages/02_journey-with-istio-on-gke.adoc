= Journey with Istio on GKE

[#istio-namespace]
== Istio namespace

We will look for components deployed automatically by Google within our cluster, especially inside the Istio namespace.

=== Services

Run the following command to see what is present in the `istio-system` namespace

[source, bash]
----
Î›\:$ kubectl get services -n istio-system
  NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                                                                                                                   AGE

Here, you see the external IP of your cluster, which is in this case, *35.228.54.223*

=== Pods

We also can look for pods used inside this namespace with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
Î›\:$ kubectl get pods -n istio-system

promsd-7b49dcb96c-cfxb2                   2/2     Running     1          3m21s

We can see the system has only one instance of each components. Istio on GKE provides some elements "configurable" to allow scalling up some core components of Istio.

You can find a list of components which *can* be modified in the Istio on GKE system: https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/overview#modifying_control_plane_settings

[#stackdriver]
== Stackdriver

You can access the multiple elements of stackdriver through the cloud console, which will help you during the multiple next step.

=== Stackdriver Monitoring

You can access the Stackdriver monitoring dashboard through the cloud console, with the *Monitoring* component in the side bar.

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/01_stackdriver-monitoring.png[Stackdriver monitoring access]

Then, you access a custom interface (out of the Google Cloud Console) dedicated to the monitoring operation

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/02_stackdriver-monitoring-dashboard.png[Stackdriver interface]

In the resource pane, you can select the Kubernetes entry to follow what is monitored inside your cluster.

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/03_kubernetes-resources-access.png[Kubernetes monitoring access]

Finally, you access the cluster view with *Infrastructure*, *Workloads* and *Services* where you can drill down to find some extra informations about components

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/04_kubernetes-resources.png[Kubernetes monitoring]

This view will be used later in the formation, so keep a link to it !

=== Stackdriver Trace

You can access the Stackdriver trace through the cloud console, with the *Trace* component in the side bar.

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/05_stackdriver-trace-access.png[Stackdriver Trace access]

So you access a screen which will presents the distributed traces inside your cluster. For now, of course, the system is empty ðŸ˜…

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/06_stackdriver-trace.png[Stackdriver Trace]

This view will be used later in the formation, so keep a link to it !

=== Stackdriver Logs

You can access the Stackdriver logs through the cloud console, with the *Logging* component in the side bar.

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/07_stackdriver-logging-access.png[Stackdriver Logging access]

Here, you can see logs from all component of the cloud console, and especially in our case, the container and cluster logs

image:02_journey-with-istio-on-gke/08_stackdriver-logging.png[Stackdriver Logging]

This view will be used later in the formation, so keep a link to it !
