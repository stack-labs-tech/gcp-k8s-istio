= Fault Injection

One of the coolest and better way to test resiliency of application is to put them under pressure or simulate this.
Here we will use some pattern which mainly associated to "Chaos Engineering" 👹

[#injecting-errors]
== Injecting Errors

You can simulate communication errors between two micro services by applying modification to a *VirtualService* (https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/virtual-service/[documentation]).

To do so, you have to apply the following *YAML*:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  hosts:
    - search
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-1
      fault:
        abort:
          percent: 50
          httpStatus: 400
----

And you can see the result by launching the curl command (or *Siege*):

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ while true; curl -qs 35.228.32.51; echo; end
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-20T21:32:54.425Z"}
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-20T21:32:55.74Z"}
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-20T21:32:57.281Z"}
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-20T21:32:58.164Z"}

[#delay]
== Delay

Since the beginning, the *Search* application has a secret paremeter, `SEARCH_MAX_LATENCY` which allows us to define the max time (choose randomly inside 0-SEARCH_MAX_LATENCY) to answer to a request.

You can set this value to 0 to make the *Search* service super fast ! ⚡️

To do so, you have to apply the following yaml:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  labels:
    app: search
    version: v1
  name: search-v1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: search
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: search
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: stacklabs/gke-and-istio-search:latest
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
            - name: SPRING_CLOUD_GCP_LOGGING_PROJECT_ID
              value: istio-csm
            - name: SEARCH_VERSION
              value: v1
            - name: SEARCH_EVENT
              value: "GKE + Istio Formation"
            - name: SEARCH_MAX_LATENCY
              value: "0"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /actuator/health
              port: 8181
            initialDelaySeconds: 20
          name: search
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: 1
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: 1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
              protocol: TCP
----

And now, you can manually add latency with Istio with a simple YAML file

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  hosts:
    - search
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-1
      fault:
        delay:
          fixedDelay: 4.000s
          percent: 50
----

You can execute a *Siege* command before applying this *YAML* and then see the evolution of latency for those requests

[source, bash]
----

1. First request to be delayed by Istio

More:

* Use stackdriver to represents the round-trip total time of a request in the mesh

[#Timeout]
== Timeout

Every language, every client http has its own way to configure default timeout... right now, with Istio you can define for all calls a default timeout for a specific route.

To do so, you have to apply this *YAML*:

1. Define the max latency to 6000ms
2. Define the timeout to 500ms

Following the result in the command line give us this:
