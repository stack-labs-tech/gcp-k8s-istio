= Fault Injection

One of the coolest and better way to test resiliency of application is to put them under pressure or simulate this.
Here we will use some pattern which mainly associated to "Chaos Engineering" ðŸ‘¹

== Injecting Errors

You can simulate communication errors between two micro services by applying modification to a *VirtualService* (https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/v1alpha3/virtual-service/[documentation]).

To do so, you have to apply the following *YAML*:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  namespace: workshop
  name: search
spec:
  hosts:
    - search
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: search
            subset: version-1
      fault:
        abort:
          percent: 50
          httpStatus: 400
----

And you can see the result by launching the curl command (or *Siege*):

[source, bash]
----
Î›\:$ while true; curl -qs 35.228.32.51; echo; end
