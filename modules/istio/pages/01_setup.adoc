= Installing a GKE cluster with Istio


[#summary]
== Summary
In this step, we will install a cluster with a managed version of Istio in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
All the tasks of this step can be done inside Google Cloud Shell or in your computer.

[#cluster-creation]
== Create the GKE Cluster with Istio

[#cluster-creation-from-ui]
=== From the UI

You can create the cluster from UI, following those steps:

1. Open cluster pages on Google Cloud Console

[#cluster-creation-from-cli]
=== From the CLI

You can create the cluster with the following comamnd:

Important: Don't forget to set your default project before running this command

WARNING: Starting in 1.12, new clusters will not have a client certificate issued. You can manually enable (or disable) the issuance of the client certificate using the `--[no-]issue-client-certificate` flag.
WARNING: The Pod address range limits the maximum size of the cluster. Please refer to https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/flexible-pod-cidr to learn how to optimize IP address allocation.
This will enable the autorepair feature for nodes. Please see https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-repair for more information on node autorepairs.

[#connect-to-cluster]
== Connect to the cluster

The cluster creation will take few minutes. Then, after the creation is complete, you have to `connect` to it.
To do so, you have to click on the `connect` button in the Google Cloud Console, in the list of clusters.

Then, you can copy/paste the command line to your CLI or execute it directly inside the Google Cloud Shell.
