= Setup Istio


[#summary]
== Summary
In this lab, you will learn how to install and configure Istio, on _Google Kubernetes Engine_.

[IMPORTANT]
.Before you begin, make sure that:
====
- You already created a GCP project and the envrionement variable ``$PROJECT_ID`` is set.
- You already cloned the directory : ``https://github.com/Sfeir/kubernetes-istio-workshop`` and all operations must take place into the root of the ``kubernetes-istio-workshop`` directory.
====



[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

You will install Istio with https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/[Google Cloud Deployment Manager] an automation tool for deploying cloud resources.

[IMPORTANT]
.to avoid loosing your settings after closing your cloudshell console you can store your different settings and variables into the ~.bashrc file which is loaded for each cloudshell session.
====
====

[#deploy-istio]
== Deploy Istio

[IMPORTANT]
.Remember !
====
- All the commands must be run in the ``kubernetes-istio-workshop`` directory.
====

[source, bash]
----
gcloud services enable runtimeconfig.googleapis.com

gcloud deployment-manager deployments create istio-cluster --config=src/infrastructure/istio/gcp/deployment_manager/istio-cluster.yaml
----

By default the tool creates a kubernetes cluster with the specified settings in the https://github.com/Sfeir/kubernetes-istio-workshop/blob/master/src/infrastructure/istio/gcp/deployment_manager/istio-cluster.yaml[istio-cluster.yaml] file, then installs the Istio control plane, https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/using-istio-dashboard/[Grafana] with https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/querying-metrics/[Prometheus], https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/servicegraph/[ServiceGraph], and https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/distributed-tracing/[Tracing]. You’ll find out more about how to access all of these in the next lab.

⏳ Wait until Istio is fully deployed. Note that the Istio installation can take up to five minutes.

Output.

[source, bash]

[#connect-cluster]
== Connect to the cluster

Once the deployment is complete, do the following on Cloud Shell :

1 - Bootstrap ``kubectl`` for the cluster you just created and confirm the cluster is running and Istio is enabled
[source, bash]
----
gcloud container clusters list --zone europe-west1-b
----

Output.
[source, bash]
----
NAME           LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION  NUM_NODES  STATUS
istio-cluster  europe-west1-b  1.9.7-gke.6     35.195.237.45  n1-standard-1  1.9.7-gke.6   3          RUNNING
----

2 - Finally, acquire the credentials to connect to the cluster.

[source, bash]
----
gcloud container clusters get-credentials istio-cluster --region europe-west1-b
----

[#verify-installation]
== Verify installation

Let's get the deployments (you can also get pods, services, etc.)

⚠️ Do not forget to specify the Istio's namespace (``-n istio-system``).

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get deployments -n istio-system
----

Output.
[source, bash]
