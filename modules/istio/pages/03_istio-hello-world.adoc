= Istio Hello World

[#deploy-application]
== Deploy Applications

To discover Istio, we will start by applying a full-featured configuration of applications and observe its behaviour through the cloud console.

We should run the following command to deploy applications in the cluster:

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ kub apply -f /Users/kevin/Workspace/gitlab.com/stack-labs/Training/gcp-k8s-istio/apps/istio/demo-hello-world.yaml
----

After that, a namespace will be created with two components:
* ui
* search

----
          +-----------------+             +---------------------+
          |                 |             |                     |
+---------+   UI Service    |------------>+   Search Service    |
          |                 |             |                     |
          +-----------------+             +---------------------+
----


You can look at deployment of each component:

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ kubectl get services,po -n workshop -o wide

service/search   ClusterIP   10.121.5.21   <none>        8080/TCP   14m   app=search,version=v1
service/ui       ClusterIP   10.121.9.78   <none>        8080/TCP   14m   app=ui

[#generate-traffic]
== Generate traffic

To generate traffic on the application, you can use `curl` or `http` command line tools. You will use the *Ingress Gateway* ip you found in the previous step to call the cluster

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ curl  35.228.54.223
{"hello":"GKE + Istio Formation","from":"ui (v1) => search (v1)","date":"2019-05-19T18:51:12.414Z"}
----

You can see the stack call made in the field `from` with the value `ui (v1) => search (v1)`.

In order to generate a lot of traffic, we will use the tool named *Siege* packaged inside the docker image `yokogawa/siege`

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:$ docker run --rm -it yokogawa/siege 35.228.54.223
** SIEGE 3.0.5
** Preparing 15 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...
----

During this operation a lots of requests are send to your cluster, so don't forget to stop it when you thinks the job is done.
To stop it, you have to type `CTRL+C`, *Siege* will present you the report of the test.

[source, bash]
----
Λ\:~ kevin $ docker run --rm -it yokogawa/siege 35.228.54.223
** SIEGE 3.0.5
** Preparing 15 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...^C
Lifting the server siege...      done.

[#traces]
== Traces

Due to the previous traffic generated, you can access the *trace* page inside the Google Cloud Console to see distributed tracing between services.

[#logging]
== Logging

You can follow logs of each application in the Google Cloud Console, in the *logging* page.
