= Monitoring and Tracing


[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
The various dashboards that we will see in this lab are not accessible outside the cluster (for obvious security reasons). To display them we need to use ``kubectl port-forward`` to create a tunnel to those services and view them as if they were running on localhost.

To display services running on localhost on Cloud Shell, it provides a feature called *Web Preview*. We will show you how to use it a little further in the document.

== Monitoring

First examine the Istio running services, and notice the presence of the following services : ``grafana``, ``prometheus``, ``jaeger-query`` and ``servicegraph``.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get services -n istio-system
----

Output.
[source,bash]

=== Grafana

- Set up a tunnel to Grafana.

NOTE: The Grafana service is running on port ``3000``. In the following command we port-forward the remote port ``3000`` to the local port ``3000``. If the local port were different, for example 8080, we would write ``8080:3000``.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n istio-system port-forward service/grafana 3000:3000 &
----

- Display the Grafana dashboard

In Cloud Shell, click on Web Preview, then change the default port to ``3000``.

image:cloud-shell-change-port2.png[Change the port]

The browser will then open a new window with URL that looks like:

[source]
----
https://3000-dot-XXXX-dot-devshell.appspot.com/?authuser=0&orgId=1
----

To display the Istio dashboard, replace the path of the URL by ``/d/1/istio-mesh-dashboard``. The URL should look like:

[source]
----
https://3000-dot-XXXX-dot-devshell.appspot.com/d/1/istio-mesh-dashboard

# or if you are on your machine

http://localhost:3000/d/1/istio-mesh-dashboard
----

Examine the dashboard, you should see some statistics for the requests you sent earlier.

=== Prometheus

As you did with Grafana, use the ``port-fowarding`` to display the Prometheus console.

*Hint*: start by finding the ``prometheus`` service port.

The Prometheus console should look like this.

image:prometheus1.png[alt text]

Let's enter a query to display the total requests sent to the ``recommendation`` service:

Enter:

[source]
----
istio_requests_total{destination_service="recommendation.workshop.svc.cluster.local"}
----

select `Execute`, and run several requests through the system:

[source,bash]
----
while true; do curl $CUSTOMER_URL; sleep .5;  done
----

Click on the *Graph* to display the graph corresponding to this query.

NOTE: You may have to refresh the browser for the Prometheus graph to update.

== ServiceGraph

- Set up a tunnel to ServiceGraph.

- You should see the service topology at:

[source]
----
https://3088-dot-XXXX-dot-devshell.appspot.com/dotviz

or

http://localhost:8088/dotviz
----

[#tracing]
== Tracing

- Set up a tunnel to the tracing dashboard.
- You should see the trace statistics.

[source]
----
https://16686-dot-XXXX-dot-devshell.appspot.com/

or

http://localhost:16686/
