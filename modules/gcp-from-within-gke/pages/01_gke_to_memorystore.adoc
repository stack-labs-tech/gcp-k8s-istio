= Connecting Kubernetes __Pod__ to GCP-managed Redis

In this chapter we will learn how to access a GCP "MemoryStore" (i.e. a managed Redis) from within our GKE cluster. We will use what we have learnt so far to:

* Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Istio enabled
* Deploy our microservices stack to Kubernetes

Once everything is deployed as we did in the first two days, we will additionally create a Redis managed instance and configure our `travel-manager` service to connect to this instance instead of an embedded standalone instance.

[#create-redis]
== Creating a GCP-managed Redis

Connect to GCP console and open the left menu to go to `MemoryStore`. Then click on "Create Instance" and fill information as follows:

TIP: Remember the region you choose here and note your Redis instance IP address.

[#create-gke-cluster]
== Creating a GKE cluster with Istio

At this step we will create a GKE cluster with Istio enabled, just as we did during Istio workshop.

NOTE: The Kubernetes cluster **must** be in the same region as the MemoryStore instance.

=== From the UI

You can create the cluster from UI, following those steps:

1. Open cluster pages on Google Cloud Console
+

2. Click on create cluster

3. Name the cluster, choose version of GKE and select 2vCPU / 7,5Gb of ram machine type

4. In advanced settigs, choose to use VPC Native and follow the parameters in the capture

5. Finally, enable the Istio module with permissive mode like in the capture

[#cluster-creation-from-cli]
=== From the CLI

You can create the cluster with the following comamnd:

Important: Don't forget to set your default project before running this command

```shell
gcloud beta container clusters create "kube-cluster" \
    --zone "europe-west1-b" \
    --no-enable-basic-auth \
    --cluster-version "1.13.5-gke.10" \
    --machine-type "n1-standard-2" \
    --image-type "COS" \
    --disk-type "pd-standard" \
    --disk-size "100" \
    --metadata disable-legacy-endpoints=true \
    --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append"
    --num-nodes "3" \
    --enable-cloud-logging \
    --enable-cloud-monitoring \
    --enable-ip-alias \
    --network "projects/${GCP_PROJECT}/global/networks/default" \
    --subnetwork "projects/${GCP_PROJECT}/regions/europe-west1/subnetworks/default" \
    --default-max-pods-per-node "110" \
    --addons HorizontalPodAutoscaling,HttpLoadBalancing \
    --enable-autoupgrade \
    --enable-autorepair
```

=== Connecting to the cluster

The cluster creation will take few minutes. Then, after the creation is complete, you have to `connect` to it.
To do so, you have to click on the `connect` button in the Google Cloud Console, in the list of clusters.

Then, you can copy/paste the command line to your CLI or execute it directly inside the Google Cloud Shell.

[#deploy-apps]
== Deploying Applications

Because the goal of this workshop is not to discover Kubernetes or Istio, we will deploy a full-featured configuration containing the following things:

* Deployment and Service for `distance-calculator`
* Deployment and Service for `travel-manager`
* Ingress Gateway so cluster entrypoint points to `travel-manager` pod

You can first have a look at the deploy plan:

```shell
cat manifests/istio-plan.yaml
```

Note that the connection string to Redis is currently not set. You first need to edit the file and replace this variable. Look for `REDIS_HOST` environment variable:

```shell
vim manifests/redis-service-entry.yaml
```

Once you replaced Redis connection string you can apply this complete plan:

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/istio-plan.yaml
```

At this point you should have deployed both microservices: check `travel-manager` logs, what can you see ?

[#enable-external-access]
== Enabling access to external services

By default, Istio blocks all outbound requests from inside the cluster. To allow outbound requests, we need to create a `ServiceEntry` for our Redis instance IP address.

Here is the `ServiceEntry` we are going to deploy:

```shell
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: managed-redis
  namespace: workshop
spec:
  hosts:
    - <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_INSTANCE_IP>
  ports:
    - number: 6379
      name: redis
      protocol: TCP
  resolution: NONE
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
```

A few things to note:

. The ServiceEntry specify a list of external hosts to allow outbound connections for
. Port number and protocol match Redis port/protocol
. Resolution is set to None as our external host is already a resolved IP address. If connecting to a named API (e.g. `storage.googleapis.com`) we need to set the resolution field to `DNS`
. Location is set to `MESH_EXTERNAL` as the service we are targeting is not part of the mesh.

In `manifests/redis-service-entry.yaml` don't forget to replace the destination host with your Redis instance IP address.

You can now apply the service-entry:

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-service-entry.yaml
```

You can now check again the `travel-manager` logs: what do you see now ?

Finally, you can access the app using cluster external IP address:

```
kubectl get services -n istio-system
curl <CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_IP>/travels
```

== Summary

In this chapter you learned how to create a Redis instance on GCP platform and connect to this instance from a GKE pod running between an Istio/Envoy proxy.
