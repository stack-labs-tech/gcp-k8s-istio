== Creating basic __Compute Instances__

[#basics-from-console]
=== From Google Cloud Console

In Google Cloud Console burger menu, select Compute Engine > VM instances.

Then click on "âž• Create Instance" and fill as followed:

image::compute-engine/apache-server-instance.png[]

Leave remaining fields untouched.

Once the image is created you should see something like this:

image::compute-engine/apache-server-created.png[]

You will note that we have both an internal and external IP. More on this later.

We will now install apache webserver on this compute instance to test connectivity.
First connect to the compute instance by clicking the `SSH` button next to your VM name:

image::compute-engine/apache-server-ssh.jpg[]

Now do install `apache2`:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

We can now access our simple Apache server through VM external IP.
You can open a browser to this IP by clicking the following link:

=== From command line and startup script

Creating a VM from Google Cloud Console is pretty easy and works well for many cases,
however in a professional context you most likely want to automate the creation of your VM and make it easily reproducible.

In this part we will use gcloud command line to create a new compute instance. We will pass it a local __startup script__ that will proceed with the actual apache server installation.

Check the content of the startup script:

```shell
cat startup-script.sh
```

You can now create the second apache server instance. We will create exactly the same instance as in the first part except that this one will be created from a startup script (and from the command line). Use this command:

```shell
gcloud compute --project=${GCP_PROJECT} instances create apache-server-2 \
  --zone=europe-west1-b \
  --machine-type=f1-micro \
  --subnet=default \
  --metadata-from-file startup-script=startup-script.sh \
  --tags=http-server \
  --image=debian-9-stretch-v20190326 \
  --image-project=debian-cloud \
  --boot-disk-size=10GB \
  --boot-disk-type=pd-standard \
  --boot-disk-device-name=apache-server-2
```

After a few seconds you should see a successful result like this one:

image::compute-engine/apache-server-2-success.png[]

You can now open your browser and access the external IP of your newly created VM. You should see this page:

image::compute-engine/apache-server-2-result.png[]

NOTE: To go one step further in the automation process we could store the startup script (e.g. as part of a CI step) and we can create a compute instance https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript#cloud-storage[using this storage startup script].
