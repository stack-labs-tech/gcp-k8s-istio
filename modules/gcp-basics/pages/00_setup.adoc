= GCP Basics

This workshop and associated lessons will navigate through some important GCP products such as _Cloud IAM_ or _Compute Engine_.

== Prerequisites

Connect to http://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud] and select (or create) a project in which you can create compute instances.

Export your project name to a variable:

```shell
GCP_PROJECT=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')
```

Verify your current project:
```shell
echo $GCP_PROJECT
```

If you need to switch GCP project, simply use this command beforehand:
```shell
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
```
