= Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

In this chapter you will create and manipulate various types of VPC :

* default network
* auto-mode network
* custom network

The objective of this chapter is to deploy these various VMs onto different network topologies:


|===
|Name |Network |Region |Zone

|instance-default
|default
|europe-west1
|europe-west1-b

|instance-auto
|my-auto-network
|europe-west1
|europe-west1-b

|instance-custom-1
|my-custom-network
|europe-north1
|europe-north1-a

|instance-custom-2
|my-custom-network
|europe-north1
|europe-north1-b

|instance-custom-3
|my-custom-network
|europe-west1
|europe-west1-b

== Creating networks

=== Default network

Nothing to do, it is already created...

=== Auto-mode network

. Create an auto-mode network named `my-auto-network`.
. Choose "Automatic" for "Subnet creation mode"
. Select all listed firewall rules
. Do create the network

=== Custom network

. Create a custom network named `my-custom-network`
. Create three subnetworks as follows:
** subnet-1a: 192.168.5.0/24 in europe-north1-a
** subnet-1b: 192.168.3.0/24, in europe-north1-b
** subnet-2: 192.168.7.0/24 in a europe-west1-b
. Create firewall rules for this network: add a rule named `allow-ssh-icmp-rdp-custom` with following params:
** network: my-custom-network
** target-tags: allow-defaults
** source IP ranges: 0.0.0.0/0
** Ports 22 & 3389
** Protocol icmp

== Testing

You should be able to ping:

* ✅ instance-default -> instance-default : with DNS resolution
* ❌ instance-default -> instance-auto : no DNS resolution outside network
* ❌ instance-default -> instance-auto **Internal IP** : not the same network
* ✅ instance-default -> instance-auto **External IP** : default firewall rules kick in
* ✅ instance-default -> instance-custom-1 **External IP** : should work after configuring appropriate firewall rules

Try opening an SSH connection to `instance-custom-2`, what happens ?
What do you need to add to enable SSH connection to this instance ?

After modifying this, you should now be able to ping:

* ✅ instance-custom-2 -> instance-custom-3
* ✅ instance-custom-2 -> instance-custom-3 **Internal IP**

=== Hints

You can either:
* Add `allow-defaults` as a tag of your instances
* Remove `allow-defaults` target tags from the firewall rules

Try both !

== Summary

In this chapter, you learned to create different types of network modes with associated routes and firewall rules.
