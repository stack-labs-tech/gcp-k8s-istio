= Creating and Managing Services

Services provide stable endpoints for Pods based on a set of labels.

In this chapter we will add new _Pods_ to complete our microservices architecture, and we will create _Services_ to expose our _Pods_ internally and externally. As a recall we aim at deploying the following architecture:

image:microservices-architecture.png[Microservices architecture]

We will learn how to:
* Create a service
* Use label selectors to expose a limited set of Pods externally == Deploy our new pods

We first need to deploy the Redis backend before we can deploy the `travel-manager` :

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/pods/redis.yaml
```

== Tutorial: Creating services

In order for our _Pods_ to communicate with each other we need to expose two of them:

* `Redis` Pod should be exposed *inside the cluster* so `travel-manager` can use it to store/get travels
* `distance-calculator` should be exposed *inside the cluster* so `travel-manager` can use it to retrieve distances.

Additionaly, we will need to expose `travel-manager` Pod *externally*.

[#internal]
=== Internal services

Explore `redis` service:

```shell
cat manifests/app/services/redis.yaml
```

Create the redis service using kubectl:

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/redis.yaml
```

Do the same thing with the `distance-calculator` service:

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/distance-calculator.yaml
```

Just like we did with pods, we can look at created services using `kubectl` command:

```shell
kubectl get services
```

TIP: All resources have aliases so you can for example type `kubectl get svc` to get the list of existing services.

==== Quizz

* What type of services did we deploy ?

[#nodeport]
=== External service: NodePort

So far we didn't specify any type for our 2 services, which means that they got the default value `ClusterIP` which only exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP as the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types[doc specifies]:

> `ClusterIP: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default `ServiceType`.

To expose our `travel-manager` externally we will now deploy a service of type https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport[`NodePort`]:

```shell
cat manifests/app/services/travel-manager-nodeport.yaml
```

Now deploy this service:

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/travel-manager-nodeport.yaml
```

==== Exercise: Interact with the Travel Manager Service Remotely

===== Hints

List the GCP VMs which compose the GKE cluster:

```shell
gcloud compute instances list
```

Output
```shell
NAME                                           ZONE            MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
gke-kube-cluster-default-pool-25c90f6c-nlft  europe-west1-b  n1-standard-2               10.132.0.12  35.195.16.10    RUNNING
gke-kube-cluster-default-pool-25c90f6c-pl74  europe-west1-b  n1-standard-2               10.132.0.14  104.155.52.100  RUNNING

```

On GCE you need to add a firewall rule to enable Ingress traffic (i.e. traffic from anywhere to your GCP project):

```shell
gcloud compute firewall-rules create travel-manager-service --allow tcp:31000
```

Then use any of the `External IP` to connect to the NodePort

```shell
curl -k http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:31000/travels
```

===== Quiz

* Why are you unable to get a response from the `travel-manager` service? __(answer below)__

==== Exercise: Explore the `travel-manager` Service

===== Hints

```shell
kubectl get services travel-manager
```

```shell
kubectl describe services travel-manager
```

===== Quiz

* How many endpoints does the `travel-manager` service have?
* What labels must a Pod have to be picked up by the `travel-manager` service?

[#labels]
==== Tutorial: Add Labels to Pods

Currently the `travel-manager` service does not have any endpoints. One way to troubleshoot an issue like this is to use the `kubectl get pods` command with a label query.

```shell
kubectl get pods -l "app=travel-manager"
```

```shell
kubectl get pods -l "app=travel-manager,version=v1"
```

> Notice this label query does not print any results

Use the `kubectl label` command to add the missing `version=v1` label to the `travel-manager` Pod.

```shell
kubectl label pods travel-manager 'version=v1'
```

View the list of endpoints on the `travel-manager` service:

```shell
kubectl describe services travel-manager
```

```

==== Tutorial: Remove Labels from Pods

In this exercise you will observe what happens when a required label is removed from a Pod.

Use the `kubectl label` command to remove the `version` label from the `travel-manager` Pod.

```shell
kubectl label pods travel-manager version-
```

View the list of endpoints on the `travel-manager` service:

```shell
kubectl describe services travel-manager
```

[#lb]
=== External service: Load Balancer

`NodePort` services are great but they are usually not used directly in production as they require that you type on a specific cluster's node to access your microservices.

We usually use a `LoadBalancer` service type instead, and GKE will manage everything for us. Let's try that. We first need to delete the old service:

```shell
kubectl delete svc travel-manager
```

Observe the new service with `LoadBalancer`:

```shell
cat manifests/app/services/travel-manager-lb.yaml
```

TIP: What is the difference with the `NodePort` version ?

We are now ready to create our `LoadBalancer` service:

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/travel-manager-lb.yaml
```

Wait until a stable external IP address has been assigned to our LoadBalancer by running the following command:

```shell
watch kubectl get svc travel-manager --output yaml
```

Once you have a value under status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip`, you can query the `travel-manager` service from the outside world by running a simple curl:

```shell
curl http://<INGRESS_IP>:60000/travels
```

==== Quizz

* How was the load balancer populated in GCP environment ?
* How was the service able to reach the container in our pods ?

== Summary

In this chapter you learned how to expose Pods using services and labels.
