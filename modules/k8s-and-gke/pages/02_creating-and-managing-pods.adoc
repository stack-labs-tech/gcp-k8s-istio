= Creating and managing pods


At the core of Kubernetes is the Pod. Pods represent a logical application and hold a collection of one or more containers and volumes, as show in below diagram:

In this chapter we will learn how to:

* Execute a simple `run` command
* Write a Pod configuration file
* Create and inspect Pods 
* Interact with Pods remotely using kubectl

In this chapter we will run a very simple nginx Pod and we will create the very first Pod of our microservices architecture : the `distance-calculator` Pod. We will also use `kubectl` command line tool to interact with our Pod.

== Tutorial: Creating Pod with run command

Wait, you told us that everything was yaml, yet we can run a container in Kubernetes without using yaml ?

Well, kind of. Just like you can do a `docker run` to launch a docker image, we can use the `kubectl run` to run a container image on a distant Kubernetes cluster. Let's create our very first pod on our cluster by deploying a `nginx` server:

```shell
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80 --replicas=1
```

What happened here ? We just asked Kubernetes to "deploy" a container image named `nginx`, which resulted in Kubernetes doing the following things:
* Create a deployment named `nginx` asking to create 1 replica (= 1 pod) of our image
* Create a pod with our `nginx` container image
* Make the pod's nginx container expose the port 80

You can verify this by asking all the resources existing on Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
kubectl get all
```

You can also ask for a description of the deployment:
```shell
kubectl describe deployment nginx
```

And a description of the pod:

```shell
kubectl describe pod <POD_NAME>
```

So far we have a running container in our distance cluster but we are unable to access it... back on this later !

== Exercise: View Pod details

Use the `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands to view details for the `distance-calculator` Pod:

=== Hints

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

```shell
kubectl describe pods <pod-name>
```

[#from-yaml]
== Tutorial: Creating Pod from yaml file

Using `kubectl run` command is pretty simple and sometimes useful to quickly deploy a simple container such as a shell container to debug something in the cluster, it gets rather hard to write as we want to add more parameters such as environment variables, mount volumes or other advanced stuff.

We will now create a Pod from a Yaml configuration file. First explore the `distance-calculator` pod configuration file:

```shell
cat manifests/app/pods/distance-calculator-v1-debug.yaml
```

Create the `distance-calculator` pod using kubectl:

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/pods/distance-calculator-v1-debug.yaml
```

=== Quiz

* What is the IP address of the `distance-calculator` Pod?
* What node is the `distance-calculator` Pod running on?
* What containers are running in the `distance-calculator` Pod?
* What are the labels attached to the `distance-calculator` Pod?
* What arguments are set on the `distance-calculator` container?

== Exercise: Interact with a Pod remotely

Pods are allocated a private IP address by default and cannot be reached outside of the cluster. Use the `kubectl port-forward` command to map a local port to a port inside the `distance-calculator` pod. 

=== Hints

Use two Cloud Shell terminals. One to run the `kubectl port-forward` command, and the other to issue `curl` commands.

```shell
kubectl port-forward <POD_NAME> 10081:80
```

Open your browser and point it to `localhost:10081` or type in the curl command : `curl "http://localhost:10081` to see Nginx default homepage !

Similarly with our `distance-calculator` Pod:

```shell
kubectl port-forward distance-calculator 10080:8082
```

```shell
curl "http://localhost:10080/distance?from=Toulouse&to=Paris"
```

Ok, so the service is dumb but at least it answers !

== Exercise: View the logs of a Pod

Use the `kubectl logs` command to view the logs for the `distance-calculator` Pod:

```shell
kubectl logs distance-calculator
```

> Use the -f flag and observe what happens.

== Exercise: Run an interactive shell inside a Pod

Use the `kubectl exec` command to run an interactive shell inside the `distance-calculator` Pod:

```shell
kubectl exec distance-calculator --stdin --tty -c distance-calculator /busybox/sh
```

List all process running inside this pod:
```shell
ps aux
```

NOTE: Running an interactive shell inside a container can be great for debugging, however it is generally considered a bad practice in production as it lowers the security of your container by providing more entrypoints.
