= Creating and managing pods


At the core of Kubernetes is the Pod. Pods represent a logical application and hold a collection of one or more containers and volumes, as show in below diagram:

In this chapter we will learn how to:

* Write a Pod configuration file
* Create and inspect Pods 
* Interact with Pods remotely using kubectl

In this chapter we will create the first Pod of our microservices architecture : the `distance-calculator` Pod. We will also use kubectl command line tool to interact with our Pod.

== Tutorial: Creating Pods

Explore the `distance-calculator` pod configuration file:

```shell
cat manifests/app/pods/distance-calculator-v1-debug.yaml
```

Create the `distance-calculator` pod using kubectl:

```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/pods/distance-calculator-v1-debug.yaml
```

== Exercise: View Pod details

Use the `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands to view details for the `distance-calculator` Pod:

=== Hints

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

```shell
kubectl describe pods <pod-name>
```

=== Quiz

* What is the IP address of the `distance-calculator` Pod?
* What node is the `distance-calculator` Pod running on?
* What containers are running in the `distance-calculator` Pod?
* What are the labels attached to the `distance-calculator` Pod?
* What arguments are set on the `distance-calculator` container?

== Exercise: Interact with a Pod remotely

Pods are allocated a private IP address by default and cannot be reached outside of the cluster. Use the `kubectl port-forward` command to map a local port to a port inside the `distance-calculator` pod. 

=== Hints

Use two Cloud Shell terminals. One to run the `kubectl port-forward` command, and the other to issue `curl` commands.

```shell
kubectl port-forward distance-calculator 10080:8082
```

```shell
curl "http://localhost:10080/distance?from=Toulouse&to=Paris"
```

Ok, so the service is dumb but at least it answers !

== Exercise: View the logs of a Pod

Use the `kubectl logs` command to view the logs for the `distance-calculator` Pod:

```shell
kubectl logs distance-calculator
```

> Use the -f flag and observe what happens.

== Exercise: Run an interactive shell inside a Pod

Use the `kubectl exec` command to run an interactive shell inside the `distance-calculator` Pod:

```shell
kubectl exec distance-calculator --stdin --tty -c distance-calculator /busybox/sh
```

List all process running inside this pod:
```shell
ps aux
```

NOTE: Running an interactive shell inside a container can be great for debugging, however it is generally considered a bad practice in production as it lowers the security of your container by providing more entrypoints.
