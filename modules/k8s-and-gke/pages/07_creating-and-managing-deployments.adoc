= Creating and Managing Deployments


Deployments abstract away the low level details of managing Pods. Pods are tied to the lifetime of the node they are created on. When the node goes away so does the Pod. ReplicaSets can be used to ensure one or more replicas of a Pods are always running, even when nodes fail.

Deployments sit on top of ReplicaSets and add the ability to define how updates to Pods should be rolled out.

In this chapter we will combine everything we learned about Pods and Services to breakup the monolith application into smaller Services. You will create 3 deployments, one for each service:

* frontend 
* auth
* hello

You will also define internal services for the `auth` and `hello` deployments and an external service for the `frontend` deployment.

== Tutorial: Creating Deployments

=== Create and Expose the Auth Deployment

Create and explore the Deployment for service `auth`:
```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/deployments/auth.yaml
kubectl describe deployments auth
```

Now create the corresponding service:
```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/auth.yaml
```

=== Create and Expose the Hello Deployment
Do the same for the `hello` deployment and services:
```shell
kubectl create -f manifests/app/deployments/hello.yaml
kubectl describe deployments hello
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/hello.yaml
```

=== Create and Expose the Frontend Deployment
And at least for the frontend:
```shell
kubectl create configmap nginx-frontend-conf --from-file=manifests/app/nginx/frontend.conf
kubectl create -f manifests/app/deployments/frontend.yaml
kubectl create -f manifests/app/services/frontend.yaml
```

== Tutorial: Scaling Deployments

Behind the scenes Deployments manage ReplicaSets. Each deployment is mapped to one active ReplicaSet. Use the `kubectl get replicasets` command to view the current set of replicas.

```
kubectl get replicasets
```

ReplicaSets are scaled through the Deployment for each service and can be scaled independently. Use the `kubectl scale` command to scale the hello deployment:

```
kubectl scale deployments hello --replicas=3
kubectl describe deployments hello
kubectl get pods
kubectl get replicasets
```

== Exercise: Scaling Deployments

In this exercise you will scale the `frontend` deployment using an existing deployment configuration file. You'll have to change the `replicas:` property to 3.

=== Hints

```
vim manifests/app/deployments/frontend.yaml
```

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/frontend.yaml
```

== Exercise: Interact with the Frontend Service

=== Hints

```
kubectl get services frontend
```

```
curl -k https://<EXTERNAL-IP>
```

== Summary

Deployments are the preferred way to manage application deployments. You learned how to create, expose and scale deployments.
