= Creating and Managing Deployments

So far we have created _Pods_ and _Services_ but we only had one instance of the same application running at a given time. Additionnaly, _Pods_ are tied to the lifetime of the node they are created on. When the node goes away so does the Pod.

To go further we will use deployments to abstract away the low level details of managing _Pods_. _ReplicaSets_ can be used to ensure one or more replicas of a Pods are always running, even when nodes fail.

Deployments sit on top of ReplicaSets and add the ability to define how updates to Pods should be rolled out.

In this chapter we will update our current microservice architecture to make each application manageable via a deployment instead of directly deploying _Pods_ units.

== Tutorial: Creating Deployments

=== Cleanup pods

First of all let's delete all running pods:

```
kubectl delete po --field-selector=status.phase='Running'
```

INFO: Note that we do not delete the services, however if you remember from previous sections, services will "unload" the endpoints as pods (with labels) that matched the service are deleted. However as we will keep the same labels in our deployments, services will detect our new pods as we deploy them.

=== Create deployments

First explore your first deployment:

```shell
cat manifests/app/deployments/distance-calculator.yaml
```

Compare this deployment file with the equivalent pod file: what are the differences ?

A few differences are noticeable:

. Of course the new resource has a _Kind_ of `Deployment` and not `Pod` anymore...
. There is a new hierarchy level: this is due to the fact that the `Deployment` is an abstraction over the `Pod`.
. We added a new field `replicas` that will allow us to scale the number of pods we want :)

Alright, time to deploy our `Deployments` to our k8s cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/distance-calculator.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/redis.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/travel-manager.yaml
```

Verify that all `Deployments` have been deployed correctly :

```
kubectl get deploy
```

We can also verify that the number of `Pods` deployed corresponds to what we asked for (3 Pods for `travel-manager and `distance-calculator` 1 for `redis`) by running the now classical command:

```
kubectl get pods
```

== Tutorial: Scaling Deployments

Behind the scenes Deployments manage ReplicaSets. Each deployment is mapped to one active ReplicaSet. Use the `kubectl get replicasets` command to view the current set of replicas.

```
kubectl get replicasets
```

ReplicaSets are scaled through the Deployment for each service and can be scaled independently. Use the `kubectl scale` command to scale the travel-manager deployment:

```
kubectl scale deployments travel-manager --replicas=5
kubectl describe deployments travel-manager
kubectl get pods
kubectl get replicasets
```

== Exercise: Scaling Deployments

In this exercise you will scale the `redis` deployment using an existing deployment configuration file. You'll have to change the `replicas:` property to 3.

=== Hints

```
vim manifests/app/deployments/redis.yaml
```

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/redis.yaml
```

== Exercise: Interact with the Travel Manager Service

Just like we did in the previous section, we can query our `travel-manager` application through the same `LoadBalancer` service as before:

```
kubectl get svc travel-manager --output yaml
```

Once you have a value under status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip`, you can query the `travel-manager` service from the outside world by running a simple curl. This time we will be using the endpoint `who` which returns the hostname of the `travel-manager` instance that was called along with the `distance-calculator` instance hostname that was called.

Try this multiple times:

```
curl http://<INGRESS_IP>:60000/who
```

You should see an output similar to this one (with another external IP address and other hostnames):

* What can we deduce from this ?

== Summary

Deployments are the preferred way to manage application deployments. You learned how to create, expose and scale deployments.
