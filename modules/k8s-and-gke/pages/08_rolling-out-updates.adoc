= Rolling out Updates


Kubernetes makes it easy to rollout updates to your applications using the builtin rolling update mechanism. In this chapter you will learn how to:

* Modify deployments to tigger rolling updates
* Pause and resume an active rolling update
* Rollback a deployment to a previous revision

== Tutorial: Rollout a new version of the Auth service

First look at the current history of the __Deployment__ resource for the `auth` service:
```shell
kubectl rollout history deployment auth
```

Then modify the auth deployment to replace the pod's container image version. Edit the yaml file.
```shell
vim manifests/app/deployments/auth.yaml
```

Look for following line and upgrade version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0:
```
image: "kelseyhightower/auth:1.0.0"
```

With `kubectl apply`, you can live-update a deployment. `--record` option let you keep a trace of the commands related to each deployment change:
```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/auth.yaml --record
kubectl describe deployments auth
```

If you list __ReplicaSets__, you'll see one for the original version and the other for the new version.
```shell
kubectl get replicasets
```

Now list __Deployment__ history again to see your change history.
```shell
kubectl rollout history deployment auth
```
In fact, __Deployment__ history is backed by the __ReplicaSet__

== Tutorial: Pause and Resume an Active Rollout

Let's try to see a deployment in progress.

First scale the hello Deployment to 6 pods:
```shell
kubectl scale deployments hello --replicas=6
```

Look at your __Deployment__ history.
```shell
kubectl rollout history deployment hello
```

Now modify the hello deployment image to update `hello` docker image`s version:
```shell
sed -i .bak 's/hello:1.0.0/hello:2.0.0/' manifests/app/deployments/hello.yaml
```
Now, run following commands all together:
```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/app/deployments/hello.yaml --record
kubectl describe deployments hello
kubectl rollout pause deployment hello
```

You'll see the __Deployment__ rolling-upgrade stopped in the middle.

Resume the rollout to terminates the rolling-upgrade.
```
kubectl rollout resume deployment hello
```

== Exercise: Rollback the Hello service

Use the `kubectl rollout undo` command to rollback to a previous deployment of the Hello service.

== Summary

In this chapter you learned how to rollout updates to your applications by modifying deployment objects to trigger rolling updates. You also learned how to pause and resume an active rolling update and rollback it back using the `kubectl rollout` command.
