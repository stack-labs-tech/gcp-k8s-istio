= Managing Application Secrets

Many applications require a way to handle secrets such as TLS certificates to run in a production environment. In this chapter you will learn how to create secrets to store sensitive application data and how to expose those secrets to the Pods at runtime

In this chapter we will create a new Pod with a new microservice named `storage-writer`. This small microservice simply writes random files to a specific Google Cloud Storage bucket. We will use a secret to pass the service account credentials to the pod.

== Tutorial: Creating Secrets

Before we create the Kubernetes secret we need to create a Google cloud service account that is authorized to write on GCS (Google Cloud Storage).

First connect to GCP console and go to `IAM & Admin` > `Service accounts`, then click on `+ Create service account` button to add a new service account. Give it a name such as `storage-admin` and click `Create`. On step 2, click on `Select a role` and then type `storage` in the search bar until you find the role `Storage Admin`. Select this role and then click `Continue`. On step 3 ignore the first part but click on `+ Create key` button to generate a JSON key associated with your new service account.

At this point you should have downloaded a JSON file corresponding to your new service account key. If you use gcloud/kubectl locally please note the path of this json file, if you use Cloud Shell please upload the file to cloud shell and note the path of the uploaded file.

We are now ready to create our Kubernetes secret from this file:

```
kubectl create secret generic gcs-admin-key --from-file=path/to/service-account-key.json
```

Examine the `gcs-admin-key` secret:

```
kubectl describe secrets gcs-admin-key
```

=== Quiz

* How many items are stored under the `gcs-admin-key` secret?
* What are key the names?

== Tutorial: Use Secrets

In this tutorial you will expose the `gcs-admin-key` secret to the `storage-writer` pod at runtime:

Examine the `storage-writer` pod configuration file:

```
cat manifests/app/pods/storage-writer.yaml
```

=== Quiz

* How are secrets exposed to the `storage-writer` Pod?

Before you deploy make sure you replace <API_KEY_FILENAME> and <UNIQUE_BUCKET_NAME> by appropriate values in `storage-writer.yaml`.

Then create the `storage-writer` Pod using kubectl:

```
kubectl create -f manifests/app/pods/storage-writer.yaml
```

TIP: Note that we are using `kubectl create` here whereas we've used `kubectl apply` so far. What's the difference ? Well `kubeclt create` corresponds to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/imperative-config/[Imperative Management] (describe what steps you want to do) whereas `kubectl apply` corresponds to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/[Declarative Management] (describe the state you want to end up with). Kubernetes is generally more-oriented towards the declarative approach.

==== Test the endpoint

Forward local port 10080 to 8083 of the `storage-writer` Pod:

```
kubectl port-forward storage-writer 10080:8083
```

Use the `curl` command to test the endpoint:

```
curl http://localhost:10080/write
```

The application should answer that it wrote a new random file to the storage.

== Summary

Secrets allow you to store application secrets and expose them to Pods at runtime. In this chapter you learned how to expose Secrets to Pods using volume mounts.
