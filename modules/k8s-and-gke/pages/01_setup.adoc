[#start-gke]
== Create Kubernetes cluster on GKE

Before deploying applications to our Kubernetes cluster... well we need a cluster !

To create a Kubernetes cluster on GKE we have two solutions (as often with GCP) : we can either use GCP console or gcloud cli.

[#create-from-gcp]
=== From GCP Console

To create a cluster from GCP console, click the 3 bar menu - aka. the __Burger__ - on the upper-right corner of the GCP Console.

When you mouse over the menu item __Kubernetes Engine__, a pin appear on the right. Click it to pin __Kubernetes Engine__ on top of the menu. You can do the same with __Compute Engine__ and __Container Registry__.

Then click on __Kubernetes Engine__ to open the list of GKE clusters.

You don't have any cluster now. Click the __Create cluster__ button to open the cluster creation wizard. Choose a "Standard cluster".

On the right part of the wizard:

* Give your cluster the name *kube-cluster*
* Choose `europe-west1-b` as Zone for this cluster (to have it closer to the user)
* In the default-pool, note (and keep) the default configuration : `3 nodes` with `1 vCPU` each.
* Click the __Create__ button to create the cluster

‚è≥ Wait until the cluster is fully started. It should takes 2-3 minutes.

[#create-from-cli]
=== From gcloud cli

To install Kubernetes from command line you first need to make sure that you have gcloud `kubectl` component installed :

```shell
gcloud components install kubectl
```

Then create a Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters create kube-cluster \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --num-nodes 3
```

NOTE: `--num-nodes` and `--machine-type` parameters are optional here because they set the default values (3 nodes clusters with n1-standard-1 machine for each node).

NOTE: We don't need to specify a region and a zone because GKE will deploy our new cluster in our project default region/zone.

[#configure-cli]
== Configure Kubernetes command-line client

List Kubernetes clusters from Cloud Shell
```shell
gcloud container clusters list
```

`kubectl` is the command-line client for Kubernetes. It's a user interface to Kubernetes REST API's.
Next command will generate a kube configuration for you (in `~/.kube/config`) to securely connect to your cluster with kubectl
```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials kube-cluster
```

You can now list the nodes composing your cluster what is running inside it
```shell
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get all
```

You have 3 nodes and a single service running in Kubernetes.
This `service/kubernetes` resource is a service exposing the REST API of your Kubernetes cluster to the Pods, allowing them to execute `kubectl` commands if they want to (very few applications do that).

You can also load kubeclt auto-completion for current bash
```shell
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```
You have to do it on each new shell or add it on your bash profile.

That way, you'll be able to list kubectl commands with :
```shell
kubectl <Tab><Tab>
```
or
```shell
kubectl get p<Tab><Tab>
```
