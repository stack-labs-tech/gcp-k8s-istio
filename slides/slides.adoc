=== High Availability and Elasticity

Cloud technologies allow for **five nine SLA** applications

Production tools REALLY exist for that today (no more a dark research field)

- Teams need to live by that new paradigm (no more “The system will be down at XXX for maintenance”)
- Bring **new challenges** (no more blocking processes like DB migration)

- K8s **Rolling updates** : manage application upgrades
- K8s **Health and Readiness probes** : allows k8s to know the app state
- K8s **Auto scaler** : react to application load and scale deployment

Deploying a new version is **NOT AN EVENT**, we should deploy ten times a day on prod!


=== Back to workshop !

=== Let's recap !

[%step]
* Running and scaling managed workloads is easy
* Do not forget the readiness and liveness probes
* Managed Kubernetes makes you not worrying about your nodes
** auto updates
** auto provisioning

=== But it is not always that easy !

[%step]
* What about **stateful** and shared-state workloads?
* How do we manage continuous and automatic updates of the application code and dependencies (database schemas, storage buckets, service accounts, etc…)?
* How do the new deployments workflows **fit with the company organization**?
* How do we implement **CI**?
* How do we **monitor**?
* How do we **secure** our application?
* What’s the **state** of a distributed application?
