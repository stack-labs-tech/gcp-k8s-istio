* Global, i.e. multi-regional

=== VPC: Different objects

* Projects
* Networks
* Subnetworks
* Regions
* Zones

=== VPC: Routes

> How to send packets **from** an instance to a destination

* To another resource inside the network
* To the outside of GCP

=== VPC: Default network routes

* Subnet to subnet routes
* Subnet to internet routes

=== VPC: Forwarding rules

> How to forward packets **to** a GCP resource

* From outside GCP: external LB
* From another resource: internal LB
